# Building an NLP search engine for art

## background

Imaging this, you just finished your visit to the Amsterdam Rijks Museum and you want to tell your friends about this amazing piece of art that you saw. It was this beautiful painting of a group of people in a bar, having a great time. However, you don't remeber the title... Now what?

You could go to [this website](https://randomrijks.com/) which shows you a random artwork from their collection, but that gives you about a 1/500.000 changes each time you request a new artwork. Not ideal. You also can go to [Rijksstudio](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/rijksstudio) and see if you can find the paiting by keyword or even color, but what if that doesn't work? Wouldn't it be great if you could just normal language, much like asking ChatGPT a question, to find what you are looking for? That is exactly what we thought!
